AIRPORT SEARCH REQUIREMENTS:

Let's say we're working for an airline, and we want to offer a service that allows users to search for flights easily.

(let's say we want to help people plan for a trip)
I want to be able to search for all flights departing from a specific city;
(let's say we want to assist people who already have plans)
I want to be able to search for all flights departing from a specific city and arriving at another specific city.

Since we want to be able to dynamically add cities and flights to our application, cities and flights should be separate entities/tables.
All other features can be left to a future sprint.
No styling or extra features are required.
For now, cities and flights are added manually to the database. (if you really want, you could add a admin tab to the page.)
